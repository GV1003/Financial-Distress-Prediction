## 🚀 Project Overview
- Predicts the **likelihood of financial distress** based on financial and operational features.
- Implements multiple machine learning models for comparison:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - AdaBoost Regressor
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluates models using **RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation**.
- Includes visualizations of data distributions and correlations.
